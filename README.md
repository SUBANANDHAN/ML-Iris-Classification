# ML-Iris-Classification
Comparing two classifier algorithms namely support vector machines algorithm and decision tree classifier algorithms to find the accuracy of model when the given features of dataset is less.
•	Developed two model for classification of Iris species using SVC algorithm and Decision Tree Classifier algorithm.
•	Compare two model by its accuracy through predict correct species according to given features.
•	Used confusion matrix technique to find how accurately the species are classified.
